Better get the shovels (1000) level: hard

NICC found out that the source of the extra spooks this time of year is due to some machine buried under NJIT's Electrical & Computer Engineering building somewhere. I guess it explains the weird noises and flickering lights...

Anna overheard a librarian talking about a device in our library that can help us close the gate letting in these spookies. She said the same engineer who opened the gate also left behind a device to close it - or so the rumor goes.

There's just one issue: the librarian said it was from around 165 years ago - long before NJIT was even built - by an engineer that owned a house on part of our campus. Does that street even exist anymore?

I'd hedge our bets that the engineer took the device to the grave. We're gonna need a map and a shovel.

Can you figure out the engineer's name and where they're buried? Be as specific as possible - we need their first name, middle initial, and last name - and the full name of the cemetery they're in. We don't want to be digging up the wrong grave.
