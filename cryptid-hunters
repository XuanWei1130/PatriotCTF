cryptid-hunters (50) level: easy

The intern found some web traffic originating from a known Consortium IP to this website. The website looks like a 7th grader's project.

Most of NICC took a look at it and blew it off, but Maya thinks there may be something worth looking into. Mary and the others tell her they are too busy and it is a waste of time. She is getting pretty sick and tired of no one taking her seriously. If she finds a lead she is going to follow it. NICC needs all the help they can get, whether its a Sasquatch or a giant clam!

hint: The hunters' webmaster is very tech illiterate. It seems like he just followed some intro level tutorial or used some free AI tool for the code.
